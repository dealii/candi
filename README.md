candi (Compile &amp; Install)
=====

The ``candi.sh`` shell script downloads, configures, builds, and installs
[deal.II](https://github.com/dealii/dealii) with common dependencies on
linux-based systems.



Quickstart
----

The following commands download the current stable version of the installer and
then install the latest deal.II release and common dependencies:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/dealii/candi.git
  cd candi
  ./candi.sh
```

Follow the instructions on the screen
(you can abort the process by pressing < CTRL > + C)


### Examples

#### Install deal.II on RHEL 7, CentOS 7 or Fedora:
```bash
  module load mpi/openmpi-`uname -i`
  ./candi.sh
```

#### Install deal.II on Ubuntu (16.04), 18.04, 20.xx:
```bash
  ./candi.sh
```

#### Install deal.II on macOS (experimental):
```bash
  ./candi.sh
```

#### Install deal.II on Windows 10 (1709):
Since the Creators Update in fall 2017 (Windows 10 (1709)) the
Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is an official part.

For a detailed instruction how to install WSL, the new WSL 2 and a recent
Ubuntu distribution on Windows 10 you can follow the
[Microsoft Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).

Within the Ubuntu terminal application, upgrade Ubuntu first, then
clone this repository and run candi

```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get upgrade
  git clone https://github.com/dealii/candi.git
  cd candi
  ./candi.sh
```

#### Install deal.II on a generic Linux system or cluster:
```bash
  ./candi.sh --platform=./deal.II-toolchain/platforms/supported/linux_cluster.platform
```

Note that you probably also want to change the prefix path, or 
the path to ``BLAS`` and ``LAPACK`` in the configuration file
(see documentation below).

#### Install deal.II on a system without pre-installed git:

```bash
  wget https://github.com/dealii/candi/archive/master.tar.gz
  tar -xzf master.tar.gz
  cd candi-master
  ./candi.sh
```

Note that in this case you will need to activate the installation of git by
uncommenting the line `#PACKAGES="${PACKAGES} once:git"` in
[candi.cfg](candi.cfg).



Advanced Configuration
----

### Command line options

#### Help: ``[-h]``, ``[--help]``
You can get a list of all command line options by running
```bash
  ./candi.sh -h
  ./candi.sh --help
```

You can combine the command line options given below.

#### Prefix path: ``[-p <path>]``, ``[-p=<path>]``, ``[--prefix=<path>]``
```bash
  ./candi.sh -p "/path/to/install/dir"
  ./candi.sh -p="/path/to/install/dir"
  ./candi.sh --prefix="/path/to/install/dir"
```

#### Multiple build processes: ``[-j<N>]``, ``[-j <N>]``, ``[--jobs=<N>]``
```bash
  ./candi.sh -j<N>
  ./candi.sh -j <N>
  ./candi.sh --jobs=<N>
```

* Example: to use 2 build processes type ``./candi.sh -j 2``.
* Be careful with this option! You need to have enough system memory (e.g. at
  least 8GB for 2 or more processes).

#### Specific platform: ``[-pf=<platform>]``, ``[--platform=<platform>]``
```bash
  ./candi.sh -pf=./deal.II-toolchain/platforms/...
  ./candi.sh --platform=./deal.II-toolchain/platforms/...
```

If your platform is not detected automatically you can specify it with this
option manually. As shown above, this option is used to install deal.II via
candi on linux clusters, for example. For a complete list of supported platforms
see [deal.II-toolchain/platforms](deal.II-toolchain/platforms).

#### User interaction: ``[-y]``, ``[--yes]``, ``[--assume-yes]``
```bash
  ./candi.sh -y
  ./candi.sh --yes
  ./candi.sh --assume-yes
```

With this option you skip the user interaction. This might be useful if you
submit the installation to the queueing system of a cluster.

#### Specific cmake version: ``[--cmake_path=<path>]``
```bash
  ./candi.sh --cmake_path="/path/to/install/dir"
```
With this option you can choose a specific cmake installation. This might be
necessary if a package requires a minimum cmake version that is not satisfied
by the version provided by your operating system.

### Configuration file options

If you want to change the set of packages to be installed,
you can enable or disable a package in the configuration file
[candi.cfg](candi.cfg).
This file is a simple text file and can be changed with any text editor.

Currently, we provide the packages

* trilinos
* petsc, slepc
* superlu_dist (to be used with trilinos)
* p4est
* hdf5
* opencascade

and others. For a complete list see
[deal.II-toolchain/packages](deal.II-toolchain/packages).

There are several options within the configuration file, for example:

* Remove existing build directories to use always a fresh setup
```bash
  CLEAN_BUILD={ON|OFF}
```

* Enable native compiler optimizations like ``-march=native``
```bash
  NATIVE_OPTIMIZATIONS={ON|OFF}
```

* Enable the build of the deal.II examples
```bash
  BUILD_EXAMPLES={ON|OFF}
```

and more.

Furthermore you can specify the install directory and other internal
directories, where the source and build files are stored:
* The ``DOWNLOAD_PATH`` folder (can be safely removed after installation)
* The ``UNPACK_PATH`` folder of the downloaded packages (can be safely removed
  after installation)
* The ``BUILD_PATH`` folder (can be safely removed after installation)
* The ``INSTALL_PATH`` destination folder


### Single package installation mode

If you prefer to install only a single package, you can do so by
```bash
  ./candi.sh --packages="dealii"
```
for instance, or a set of packages by
```bash
  ./candi.sh --packages="opencascade petsc"
```

### Developer mode

Our installer provides a software developer mode by setting
``DEVELOPER_MODE=ON``
within [candi.cfg](candi.cfg).

More precisely, the developer mode skips the package ``fetch`` and ``unpack``,
everything else (package configuration, building and installation) is done
as before.

Note that you need to have a previous run of candi and
you must not remove the ``UNPACK_PATH`` directory.
Then you can modify source files in ``UNPACK_PATH`` of a package and
run candi again.
