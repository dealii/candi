# Then run candi again.

# The default compiler on ubuntu14 does not support Trilinos 12
# together with deal.II v8.3.0.
# Note: this issue is resolved in the current development trunc
# of deal.II (v8.4pre).
# Anyhow, the user can decide to use Trilinos 11 or 12, if the
# version number is not set to AUTO.
# The last point is due to own compilers (e.g. intel) which support
# Trilinos 12.
